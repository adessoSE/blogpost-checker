# blogpost-checker
Run checks to verify metadata of blog posts üìÑ‚úîÔ∏è (Designed for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) blogs).

Terminates with a non 0 status on [errors](#Error-codes) ‚ùå.
Can be integrated with GitHub Actions to [check incoming pull requests](#Execution-via-GitHub-Action) üö¶.
Used in production for our very own [adesso devblog](github.com/adessoAG/devblog).

## Executed checks
By default, executed checks depend on `authors.yml` and the metadata of the most recent blog post.
We thus have two sets of checks that will be run.
You can add [custom checks as well](#Adding-custom-checks).

### Checking post metadata
Metadata for adesso blog posts is expected to look like this:

```
---
layout: [post, post-xml]              
title:  "Title"
date:   YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM      
modified_date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
author_ids: [authorNickname]
categories: [a single category]
tags: [tag 1, tag2, tag 3]
---
```

These checks are currently executed for the post metadata:
* `categories` cannot be empty
* `categories` must contain only one entry
* `categories` must be placed in brackets (`[ ]`)
* `tags` cannot be empty
* `tags` must be placed in brackets (`[ ]`)
* `author_ids` cannot be empty
* `author_ids` the names must be listed in the authors.yml file
* `title` cannot be empty
* `title` has to be placed in quotes
* `layout` must equal [post, post-xml]
* `date` cannot be empty
* `date` must match the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm`

### Checking authors data
Every entry in `authors.yml` is expected to look like this.
A post's metadata has to have a nickname that is listed in that file.

```yml
authorNickname:
  first_name: first name
  last_name: last name
  bio: "author bio"
  avatar_url: /assets/images/avatars/<author imange name>.png
  github: github link to author
```

These checks are currently executed for the `authors.yml`:
* `first_name` cannot be empty
* `last_name` cannot be empty
* `bio` cannot be empty
* `avatar_url` cannot be empty
* `github` cannot be empty

# Usage
Blogpost-Checker comes in a docker container and can either be used standalone or in a GitHub Action.
A non zero exit code will indicate a failed check.
This mechanism can be applied to check pull requests.

## Required arguments
Two arguments are required to run the application:
- `REPOSITORY_REMOTE_URL` = https://a-url-to-your-repository
- `REPOSITORY_BRANCH_NAME` = the-git-branch-to-be-checked

Updates to the codebase are pushed to [jekyll2cms/blogpost-checker](https://hub.docker.com/r/jekyll2cms/blogpost-checker).
Make sure to explicitly set the tag to `1.0.0`.
At this point, no [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) is implemented.

# Execution via GitHub Action
Create a workflow file in `.github/workflows/run-blogpost-checker.yml`

```yml
name: run-blogpost-checker

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  pull-and-run-blogpost-checker:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Inject env
        uses: rlespinasse/github-slug-action@v3.x

      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: git log
        run: |
          MESSAGE=`cd /home/runner/work/devblog/devblog && git log --pretty=oneline`
          echo "$MESSAGE"
          HEAD_COMMIT=`echo "$MESSAGE" | sed -e 's/\(.*\)Merge\s\(.*\) into \(.*\)/\2/'`
          BASE_COMMIT=`echo "$MESSAGE" | sed -e 's/\(.*\)Merge\s\(.*\) into \(.*\)/\3/'`
          export HEAD_COMMIT="$HEAD_COMMIT"
          export BASE_COMMIT="$BASE_COMMIT"
          echo "::set-env name=HEAD_COMMIT::$HEAD_COMMIT"
          echo "::set-env name=BASE_COMMIT::$BASE_COMMIT"
        env:
          ACTIONS_ALLOW_UNSECURE_COMMANDS: 'true'

      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          repository: ${{ github.event.pull_request.user.login }}/${{ env.GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME_PART }}
          ref: ${{ env.HEAD_COMMIT }}
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Run Docker image
        run: docker run --env BASE_COMMIT='${{ env.BASE_COMMIT }}' --env HEAD_COMMIT='${{ env.HEAD_COMMIT }}' --env LOCAL_REPO_PATH=repo --env PR_NUMBER='${{ github.event.number  }}' -v /home/runner/work/devblog/devblog:/repo jekyll2cms/blogpost-checker:1.0.5
```

In the case of the adesso devblog, we want every pull request to be checked and thus set `REPOSITORY_BRANCH_NAME` dynamically to the current branch.
This is achieved via `${{ github.head_ref }}`.

We also use a [GitHub Secret](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) to store `REPOSITORY_REMOTE_URL`.
You don't have to though.

# Execution via Docker
The process is very similar.
Environment arguments are passed as simple strings though.

```docker
docker run 
--env REPOSITORY_REMOTE_URL=https://a-url-to-your-repository 
--env REPOSITORY_BRANCH_NAME=the-git-branch-to-be-checked 
jekyll2cms/blogpost-checker:1.0.0
```

# Execution via Gradle
The application can be run directly from your IDE.
We recommend this approach only for development purposes.

1. Initialize the [Gradle](https://gradle.org/ ) project
2. Make sure to set the environment arguments!
3. Run `gradle bootRun`.

Follow this guide to [define environment arguments in IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/objc/add-environment-variables-and-program-arguments.html#add-environment-variables).

## Known issue with Gradle execution
There is a known issue with consecutive runs:

```java
UNDEFINED EXCEPTION
org.eclipse.jgit.api.errors.JGitInternalException: Destination path "repository-to-be-checked" already exists and is not an empty directory
```

Delete the `repository-to-be-checked` directory and try again if you encounter this error.

# Adding custom checks
Your custom check methods should be added inside `CheckExecutor.java`.
A post's metadata and the author value can be passed as arguments.

The method structure might look like this:

```java
private void checkMyCustomCondition(PostMetadata metadata, String authors) {
    if ( < your check condition > ) {
        LOGGER.info("<your check was susccessful>");
    } else {
        ExitBlogpostChecker.exit(LOGGER, "<your check failed due to your condition not being met>", < your custom error code > );
    }
}
```
